# Web Developer task 2026

You will receive two attachments along with this task:

- Template snippet (for Part 1)
- team_data.json data (for Parts 2 and 3)

Please use these files as the basis for your work.

## TASK

### 1. Code review / refactoring suggestions (PHP)

Based on the provided PHP template snippet, describe how you would improve this code.

You don’t have to write fully working code; a short write-up in .md, .pdf or .txt explaining your approach and/or showing small, refactored examples is enough.

### 2. Component design (UI/UX)

Using any tool you prefer, create a mock-up of: a) a team member card and b) a list of cards within a page based on the provided team data.

A screenshot or export of your mock-up, or a link to an online tool is sufficient.

### 3. Implementation (modern frontend)

Using any modern frontend tooling you prefer, implement your mock-up and display a list of team member cards using the provided team data.

Please include brief instructions in a README on how to run your solution. Your submission may be provided as a Git repository link, or a zipped project folder.

## Notes

Please don’t spend more than a few hours on this exercise; we’re more interested in your approach and reasoning than in perfect polish. 😊
